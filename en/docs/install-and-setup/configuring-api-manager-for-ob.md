WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator contains TOML-based configurations. All the server-level configurations of the 
API Manager instance can be applied using a single configuration file, which is the `deployment.toml` file. 

## Configuring deployment.toml

Follow the steps below to configure the `deployment.toml` file and set up the default open banking flow for WSO2 API 
Manager.

!!! tip
    If you want to customize and learn more about TOML configurations, see 
    [API Manager Configuration Catalog for open banking](../references/config-catalog-apim.md).

1. Replace the `deployment.toml` file as explained in the 
[Setting up the servers](setting-up-servers.md#copying-the-deploymenttoml) section.
 
2. Open the `<APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

3. Set the hostname of the API Manager:

    ``` toml
    [server]
    hostname = "<APIM_HOST>" 
    ```

4. Update the datasource configurations with your database properties, such as the username, password, JDBC URL for the 
database server, and the JDBC driver. 

    - Given below are sample configurations for a MySQL database. For other DBMS types and more information, 
    see [Setting up databases](setting-up-databases.md).
   
    ```toml tab='shared_db'
    [database.shared_db]
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbank_govdb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false"
    username = "root"
    password = "root"
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    ```
    
    ```toml tab='apim_db'
    [database.apim_db]
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbank_apimgtdb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false"
    username = "root"
    password = "root"
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    ```
    
    ```toml tab='config'
    [database.config]
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbank_am_configdb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false"
    username = "root"
    password = "root"
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    ```
    
    ```toml tab='WSO2UM_DB'
    [[datasource]]
    id="WSO2UM_DB"
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbank_userdb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false"
    username = "root"
    password = "root"
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    ```

5. Update the following configurations with the hostname of the Identity Server.  
   
    ``` toml
    [apim.key_manager]
    service_url = "https://<IS_HOST>:9446${carbon.context}services/"
    ```
   
    ``` toml
    [apim.key_manager.configuration]
    ServerURL = "https://<IS_HOST>:9446${carbon.context}services/"
    ```
   
    ``` toml
    [open_banking.dcr]
    #jwks_endpoint_name = ""
    #app_name_claim = " "
    token_endpoint = https://<APIM_HOST>:9443/oauth2/token
    ```

6. Add the following and configure the hostname of the Identity Server.  

    ``` toml
    [open_banking.gateway.consent.validation]
    endpoint = "https://<IS_HOST>:9446/api/openbanking/consent/validate"
    ```
   
7. Add the following gateway executor configurations for the Consent flow:

    ``` toml
    [[open_banking.gateway.openbanking_gateway_executors.type]]
    name = "Consent"
    [[open_banking.gateway.openbanking_gateway_executors.type.executors]]
    name = "com.wso2.openbanking.accelerator.gateway.executor.impl.selfcare.portal.UserPermissionValidationExecutor"
    priority = 1
    ```

8. Add the following tags and configure the HTTP connection pool:

    !!! info
        This is only available as a WSO2 Update from **WSO2 Open Banking API Manager Accelerator Level 3.0.0.7** and 
        **WSO2 Open Banking Identity Server Accelerator Level 3.0.0.10** onwards.
        For more information on updating, see [Getting WSO2 Updates](setting-up-servers.md#getting-wso2-updates).

    ``` toml
    [open_banking.http_connection_pool]
    max_connections = 2000
    max_connections_per_route = 1500	
    ```
   
9. If you want to use the [Data publishing](../learn/data-publishing.md) feature:
   
    - Enable the feature and configure the `server_url` property with the hostname of WSO2 Streaming 
    Integrator.

    ``` toml
    [open_banking.data_publishing]	
    enable = true	
    username="$ref{super_admin.username}@carbon.super"	
    password="$ref{super_admin.password}"	
    server_url = "{tcp://<SI_HOST>:7612}"	
    ```  

10. If you are using WSO2 API Manager 4.2.0, you need to change the API Manager REST API version from V2 to V3.

    1. Locate the `[open_banking.dcr.apim_rest_endpoints]` tag. By default, the configuration is commented out.
    2. Uncomment the configuration and update as shown below:
        ```toml
        [open_banking.dcr.apim_rest_endpoints]
        app_creation = "api/am/devportal/v3/applications"
        key_generation = "api/am/devportal/v3/applications/application-id/map-keys"
        api_retrieve = "api/am/devportal/v3/apis"
        api_subscribe = "api/am/devportal/v3/subscriptions/multiple"
        retrieve_subscribe="api/am/devportal/v3/subscriptions"
        ```
   
## Starting servers

1. Go to the `<APIM_HOME>/bin` directory using a terminal.

2. Run the `wso2server.sh` script as follows:

    ``` bash
    ./api-manager.sh
    ``` 

## Configure Identity Server as Key Manager

The **Key Manager** handles all clients, security, and access token-related operations. In a typical API Manager 
production deployment, different components talk to the Key Manager component to achieve different tasks.

This section explains how to configure WSO2 Identity Server as the Key Manager for WSO2 API Manager.

1. Sign in to the Admin Portal of API Manager at `https://<APIM_HOST>:9443/admin`.

2. Go to **Key Manager** on the left main menu. ![add_Key_Manager](../assets/img/learn/dcr/dcr-try-out/step-9.png)

3. Click **Add New Key Manager** and configure Key Manager.
